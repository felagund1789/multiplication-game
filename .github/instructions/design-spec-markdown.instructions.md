# Design Spec Markdown Consistency

Use this format for design-spec style markdown files.

## Required Section Order

3. Information architecture
4. Layout and hierarchy
5. Interaction states
6. Responsive behavior
7. Accessibility requirements
8. Acceptance criteria
9. Open questions

## Writing Rules

- Use direct, implementation-ready language.
- Keep requirements measurable and testable.
- Avoid framework names, library names, and code snippets in design specs.
- Define behavior for loading, empty, and error states.
- Include keyboard and focus expectations for interactive elements.

## Formatting Rules

- Use sentence case headings.
- Use short bullet points for requirements.
- Use numbered lists only for ordered procedures.
- Keep one requirement per bullet where possible.
- Avoid duplicated sections and repeated wording.

## Requirement Pattern

Use this sentence pattern for concrete requirements:

- "When [condition], the UI should [observable behavior], so the user can [goal]."

## Final Review Checklist

- Sections are in the required order.
- States include default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty, and error.
- Responsive guidance covers mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Accessibility requirements include semantics, keyboard flow, and contrast intent.
- Acceptance criteria can be validated by QA or tests.
